# Why Podman over Docker?

Both support rootless containers, but the key difference is architectural. Docker always requires
a background daemon (`dockerd`) running on the host. Even in rootless mode, that daemon is a
persistent process managing all your containers. Podman is **daemonless**: each container is a
direct child process of the user who launched it, with no central coordinator. When you run
`podman compose up`, your containers are just processes owned by your user account, nothing more.

For a stack that handles private network traffic, eliminating that daemon removes a whole class of
risk: there is no long-running privileged process to exploit, no Unix socket to misconfigure, and
no single point of failure that can take down every container at once.

**Already using Docker and don't want to change your workflow?** Install the `podman-docker`
compatibility package. It drops in a `docker` wrapper that forwards all `docker` and `docker
compose` commands to Podman transparently. Your existing scripts, aliases, and muscle memory
continue to work unchanged.

```shell
# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install podman podman-docker podman-compose xmlstarlet wireguard-tools

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install podman podman-docker podman-compose xmlstarlet wireguard
```

Set `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman` (or `docker`) in your `.env` file to make your choice explicit. If
left unset, the `Makefile` auto-detects: Podman wins when both are installed.

## Using ports 80 and 443 with rootless Podman or rootless Docker

Both runtimes in rootless mode run as your regular user, and the Linux kernel blocks unprivileged
users from binding ports below 1024 by default. The default configuration therefore uses `8080`
and `8443` so everything works out of the box without any extra steps. `make bootstrap` asks about
this interactively (defaulting to the rootless-safe `8080`/`8443`), running the `sysctl` command
below with `sudo` on your behalf if you opt in to the standard ports; the rest of this note is for
setting it up by hand instead, or afterward if you skipped the prompt.

If you prefer the standard ports, set `NGINX_HTTP_PORT=80` and `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT=443` in your
`.env`, then lower the kernel's port boundary. To apply it for the current session only (resets on
reboot):

```shell
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
```

To make it permanent across reboots, add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```text
net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
```
