# Claude Code PreToolUse hook for the Bash tool. Reads the hook payload on
# stdin and refuses two classes of git command. Printing nothing allows the
# command, so every path that is not an explicit refusal must fall through to
# the exit 0 at the bottom.
#
# Enforces three rules that were previously prose in CLAUDE.md and were broken
# anyway:
#
#   1. No skipping the pre-commit hooks. They run the secret scanners, and a
#      bypass is how an unscanned change reaches a public repository.
#   2. No working-tree git operations while the stack is running. pre-commit
#      stashes the working tree, and doing that against live SQLite databases
#      corrupted them on 2026-07-07.
#   3. No committing into a clone where the hooks were never installed. Rule 1
#      catches a deliberate bypass, but a fresh clone reaches the same place
#      with no flag at all: git clone does not install them, so every commit
#      silently runs nothing and still reports success.
