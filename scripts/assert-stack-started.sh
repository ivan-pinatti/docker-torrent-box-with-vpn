# Usage: ./scripts/assert-stack-started.sh --file a.yml --file b.yml ...
#
# Decides whether the stack came up by looking at what is running, rather than
# by trusting `compose up --detach` to return. Two separate problems make that
# necessary, and this is the one check that answers both.
#
# `podman-compose up --detach` intermittently never returns even though every
# container is created and running. CI bounded it at 420s and treated the
# interrupt as failure, so a stack that was demonstrably up reported a failed
# build: three consecutive runs across two unrelated branches stalled at
# "Starting all containers..." with 27, 33 and 33 containers already running.
# It became consistent rather than occasional when CI started applying
# .env.tests, which took the service count from 22 to 36.
#
# The opposite failure is just as quiet. podman-compose returns 0 even when
# every individual container fails to create, so `make start` could report
# success having created nothing at all: 33 "the container name is already in
# use" errors, an empty pod, exit code 0. Nothing downstream noticed either,
# because the readiness wait greps for containers reporting "starting" and an
# empty stack matches none, after which every test skips itself and the suite
# passes having tested nothing.
#
# Comparing the enabled service list against the services actually running
# replaces both a command's exit status and a grep for absence with the
# question that was meant all along.
#
# Services are matched through the compose project and service labels, not
# through container names, so this is unaffected by anything that renames a
# container.

# COMPOSE_UP_PID, when the caller passes one, is a `compose up` still running in
