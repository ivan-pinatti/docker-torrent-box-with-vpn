# Usage: ./scripts/schedule-backup.sh
# Installs (or replaces) a cron entry that runs `make backup` (the lean
# config backup) on a schedule. Prompts for frequency and time in a real
# terminal; in a non-interactive run it applies the default (daily at
# 03:00) without prompting, since scheduling a backup is a safe, reversible
# action, unlike Gluetun's VPN credentials where guessing would be actively
# wrong. Re-running this script replaces the previously scheduled entry
# rather than stacking a second one, identified by MARKER below.
