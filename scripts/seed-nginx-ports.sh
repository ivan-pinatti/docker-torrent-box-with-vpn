# Prompts once during bootstrap to use the standard ports 80/443 instead of
# this project's rootless-safe defaults (8080/8443). Rootless Podman/Docker
# run as the invoking user rather than root, and the kernel blocks
# unprivileged binds below net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start (1024 by
# default), so 80/443 need that boundary lowered first; this offers to do
# it here with sudo instead of pointing at README instructions to run by
# hand later. Skips entirely, keeping the rootless-safe defaults, once
# .env's ports no longer match the placeholder defaults (already
# customized) or when not running interactively.
