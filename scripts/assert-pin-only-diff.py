"""Refuse a unified diff that changes anything but a dependency pin.

Read a diff on stdin (`gh pr diff <n> | scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py`) and
exit non-zero unless every changed file is one of the pin files below and every
changed line differs from its counterpart in nothing but a version or digest.

This is the check that stands between "renovate[bot] opened a pull request" and
an unattended merge. Without it, approving a bot's pull request on the strength
of its author means the bot identity holds write access to main: a compromised
Renovate, or a Renovate whose configuration has been edited to widen what it
manages, could rewrite a workflow and be approved for it. Two of the five
allowed paths are executable surfaces on their own, since the pip pins live in
workflow `run:` steps and the scanner image tags live inside pre-commit hook
`entry:` commands, so a path allowlist alone would not be much of a fence. The
line comparison is what makes it one.

The comparison normalizes both sides and requires them to match line for line
per file, duplicates counted. A line whose structure changed has no counterpart
and the diff is refused, which covers `uses: actions/checkout@v7` becoming
`uses: evil/checkout@v7` as much as it covers an added `curl | sh`. Anything
this refuses is not broken, it just waits for a person: the approval is skipped
and the pull request sits there, which is the direction to fail in.

Only a number in a pin position is treated as substitutable, which is narrower
than "any number on the line" and deliberately so. `PUID=1000` becoming
`PUID=0`, or a `timeout-minutes:` moving, are numeric edits with real effects
that a looser rule would wave through, so they are refused like any other
structural change. The residue is a number that sits in a pin position and is
not a pin, which in these five files means an image tag's port-like suffix and
little else.

What it deliberately does not catch: a bump to a version that exists but is
malicious. `checkov==3.3.2` becoming `checkov==3.3.11` is the change this file
exists to permit, and no amount of diff reading can tell a good release from a
backdoored one. That is what the cooling window in .github/renovate.json5, the
integration suite, and the scanners are for. See docs/HARDENING.md.

# a floating ref like `main` is made entirely of characters that shape would
# otherwise accept.
RELEASE = r"v?[0-9][0-9A-Za-z.+_-]*"

# Removed outright rather than replaced with a placeholder: Renovate's
# pinDigests adds a digest to a line that had none, so a placeholder would make
# the before and after differ by its presence and refuse a legitimate first pin.
# This is a Docker image digest (`.env.example` only); a GitHub Actions SHA pin
# is handled separately below, because it can carry a trailing release comment
# that has to normalize together with the SHA.
DIGEST = re.compile(r"@sha256:[0-9a-f]{7,}")

# A GitHub Actions pin: a full 40 character commit SHA, optionally followed by
# a trailing release comment (`# v7`, `# v7.0.1`) that Dependabot rewrites on
# the same bump whenever the tag the SHA resolves from changes. Both have to
# normalize together: an earlier version of this script normalized only the
# SHA and left the comment as ordinary text, so an ordinary bump that also
# moved `# v7` to `# v7.0.1` read as a structural change and `Pin Only`
# refused a diff that was actually pin-only. Every grouped Actions update
# makes this a near-certainty rather than an edge case, since one bump is
# enough to trip it.
#
# The comment is folded into the normalization only when it is actually a
# release token running to the end of the line; anything else after the SHA,
# including a comment with extra text trailing a valid version token, is left
# alone, so it is still read as a structural change if it differs between the
# two sides. The negative lookahead after the hex run stops a 40 character
# prefix of a longer hex run (a sha256 digest, in particular) from matching
# and silently swallowing the character that would have made the shapes
# differ.

# The six prefixes are the shapes a pin takes everywhere except .tool-versions,
# which is handled whole-line above:
#
#   ==1.2.3              pip, in a workflow run step or additional_dependencies
#   >=1.2.3              pip, in tests/requirements.txt, which pins floors
#                        rather than exact versions
#   @v1.2.3              an action ref, and what is left after a digest is cut
#   FOO_VERSION=1.2.3    .env.example, where a bare `=` is not enough: PUID and
#                        the port variables use one too
#   rev: v1.2.3          a pre-commit hook revision
#   image:1.2.3          a tag, the colon pressed against a non-space so that a
#                        YAML `key: 25` cannot pass for one
#
# `>=` was missing until it was noticed on PR #94, a Dependabot bump of
# tests/requirements.txt, which that pull request has been failing `Pin Only`
# on ever since: every line in that file is a `>=` floor, so no bump of it
# could ever grade pin-only and every one of them waited for a person for a
# reason nobody could see from the status. Only `>=` is added, not the rest of
# pip's operator vocabulary: `==` and `>=` are the only two that appear
# anywhere in ALLOWED_PATHS, and inventing shapes this repository does not use
# would widen what a bot may push for no benefit. The prefix is still captured
# and put back, so `docker>=7.2.0` becoming `docker==7.2.0` is a change of pin
# shape and still reads as a difference.
# The prefix is captured and put back, so that a pin changing shape rather than
# value, `foo==1.2.3` becoming `foo@1.2.3`, still reads as a difference.
# The token is any tag-shaped run of characters, and the narrowing lives entirely
# in the prefix rather than in the shape. Two rounds of guessing at the shape
# were both wrong: `\d+(\.\d+)*` matched only the `40` of lazylibrarian's
# `40a389ea-ls310` and refused PR #62, and requiring a leading digit still
# refused `KORSYNC_VERSION=sha-7bcefd34...`, which is what korsync was pinned to
# at the time. It has since moved to a plain `0.2.3`, but the shape has to stay
# accepted: nothing stops the next pin being a commit tag again, and this file
# is the wrong place to find that out. `stable-alpine` and `latest` are in
# .env.example too.
#
# Being this permissive about the value costs nothing, because whatever is being
# pinned is always named to the *left* of the prefix and stays literal:
# `actions/checkout@v7` becoming `attacker/checkout@v7` still fails, as does
# `checkov==3.3.2` becoming `evil==3.3.2`. What a bump is allowed to change is
# the value in a pin position, and only there, which is why `PUID=1000` is
# untouched by this and a change to it is refused.
