"""Generate configs/homepage/config/services.yaml from services.yaml.template,
dropping any app whose compose profile is disabled in .env, and dropping any
section left empty as a result. Run on every `make start`, not just bootstrap,
so flipping a profile and restarting is enough to update Homepage; see the
comment at the top of services.yaml.template.

Also expands `${VAR}` from .env, which is what lets a widget point at an address
the deployment actually uses instead of a literal. The template used to hard code
gluetun's services address, so any checkout whose .env moved that subnet
regenerated a Homepage that pointed at the previous deployment's address on every
`make start`, and the widget answered with a timeout. Homepage's own
`{{HOMEPAGE_FILE_*}}` placeholders use different delimiters and are left alone.
