"""Decide the `Review Verified` status from a pull request's own state.

Read a small JSON object on stdin (assembled by
`.github/workflows/coderabbit-gate.yml` from the GitHub API, never from an
event payload) and print `state=<success|pending|failure>` and
`description=<text>` on stdout, in the shape `>> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` expects.

This is the fix for #114: `CodeRabbit` reports `success` on three outcomes
that are not the same thing. `Review completed` means a review happened.
`Review rate limited` means the quota was exhausted and nothing read the
diff. A skipped draft means CodeRabbit never looked because it was told not
to. Branch protection cannot tell these apart, because the legacy commit
status API it reads has no fifth state for "green but not for the reason you
think", and three pull requests (#86, #87, #88) merged with no review ever
having happened on 2026-08-19 as a direct result. `Review Verified` exists to
be the context that can tell them apart, so it is required instead of
`CodeRabbit` and grades every one of those outcomes as `failure` rather than
inheriting their `success`.

Three lanes, decided in this order:

1. A draft is `pending`, not `failure`.
CodeRabbit has not reviewed it because it was told not to (`drafts: false` in
.coderabbit.yaml), which is a deliberate wait rather than a decline, and a
required context that reads red for a pull request's entire draft phase
teaches nothing. Pending blocks the merge exactly as hard as failure does, so
nothing merges early either way.

2. A dependency bot pull request (`renovate[bot]` or `dependabot[bot]`, from
an account with write access, so never a fork) is graded on
`scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py`'s verdict instead of CodeRabbit's, because
CodeRabbit never reviews a bot's pull request at all (#113, confirmed
upstream: bot authors are hardcoded to be ignored). Requiring its review there
would block every bot pull request forever, which is the deadlock #114
explicitly ruled out. A pin-only diff has nothing in it a review would catch
beyond what the assertion already read line by line, so it passes unattended,
same as it does today. A diff that fails the assertion is not pin-only, which
is the one shape a bot pull request can take that a human would normally have
opened instead, so from there it is graded exactly like a human pull request:
it already gets no automatic approval either way (`bot-auto-merge.yml`
withholds one), so a person is already looking, and asking for a real review
alongside that cannot stall the happy path.

3. Everything else, human authored or a bot pull request whose diff already
failed the pin-only assertion, is `success` only when the latest `CodeRabbit`
status description is exactly `Review completed`. Absent, `Review queued`, or
`Review in progress` is `pending`: a review that has been asked for and not
yet returned, or is actively running, has not declined anything, and reading
it as a failure would turn every ordinary review's opening minutes into a red
required check for no reason. Anything else present, `Review rate limited`,
any `Review skipped: ...` description reaching this lane (a non-bot pull
request is never a draft by the time this runs, since lane 1 already caught
that), an error state, or a description this has never seen before, is
`failure`. No exceptions there: this lane is where the three unreviewed
merges happened, and a status this script does not recognize is exactly the
shape a future change to CodeRabbit's wording would take, so only the two
known in-flight strings above move to `pending`; nothing else gets the
benefit of the doubt.

Fails closed throughout. An unset or unrecognized `pin_only_state` for a bot
pull request is treated as "not yet known" rather than "assume clean", which
reads `pending` rather than `success`; an unrecognized `is_fork` is treated as
a fork, which is the reading that cannot grant the unattended bot lane to
something that should not have it.
