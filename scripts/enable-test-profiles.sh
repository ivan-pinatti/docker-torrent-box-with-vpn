# Applies .env.tests' profile overrides onto .env, then seeds the local
# mock VPN endpoint if one is needed (scripts/seed-vpn-mock.sh decides
# that for itself). Called by `make bootstrap_tests`, never by plain
# `make bootstrap` or `make start`. Never run this against a real
# deployment: it changes which profiles are enabled in .env, the same way
# bootstrap's own credential rotation permanently changes every password.

# UID and GID ship as 1000 in .env.example, which is right on a typical bench and
# wrong anywhere else. Three observability services mount the rootless podman
# socket from /run/user/${UID}/podman, so a value that is not the invoking user's
# makes that path not exist and podman refuses the container outright: "statfs
# /run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock: no such file or directory". Seen on a runner
# whose user is 1001, where cadvisor, podman_exporter and podman_limits_exporter
# all failed to be created and `make start` reported 3 of 36 services missing.
#
# Derived rather than asked for, because there is no case where a test run wants
# a UID other than the one invoking it.

# belongs to podman's version, and anyone on a 4.x runtime hits it identically.
