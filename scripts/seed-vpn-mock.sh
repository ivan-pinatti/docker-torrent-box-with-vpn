# only when there's no real VPN key to protect: a real key already in
# place is never touched or overwritten. Only ever called from
# scripts/enable-test-profiles.sh (make bootstrap_tests), never from plain
# make bootstrap.

# The four shared networks are named ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_<name>, so the
# ones seeded here have to carry the name compose will later look them up
# under, or `external: true` fails with "network not found".
#
# The precedence is .env, then an inherited value, then this checkout's own
# directory name, and it is in that order deliberately: it has to match the
# Makefile, which is what creates these same networks on every other path.
# The Makefile gets that order from `include .env`, since a makefile assignment
# beats the environment, so reading the environment first here would resolve to
# a different name than make did whenever a shell exports one value and .env
# carries another. The networks would then be created under one name while
# compose looked up the other.
#
# `|| true` is load bearing: env_value greps, grep exits 1 on no match, and
# under `set -euo pipefail` the failing substitution in an assignment takes the
# whole script with it. Most checkouts do not set this key at all, so the
# common case is exactly the one that would abort.

# prior run died in between (confirmed live: an unrelated missing .env var
# made the later step fail), a rerun would see the already-saved key and
# skip everything, leaving gluetun permanently configured for its original
# real provider while holding mock key material, dialing real servers
# forever and never passing its own healthcheck. So both halves of the job
# have to check out before this counts as already done.
