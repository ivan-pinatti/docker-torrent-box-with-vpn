# Usage: ./scripts/wire-connections.sh
#
# Wires the app-to-app connections that can only exist through each app's own
# live API: qBittorrent and SABnzbd as download clients inside Sonarr, Radarr,
# Lidarr, Readarr, and Whisparr, and those apps (plus LazyLibrarian and Mylar)
# registered as Applications in Prowlarr, if it's enabled. Prowlarr also gets
# Internet Archive added as its one default indexer, a legal public source
# (a nonprofit digital library) whose categories actually cover what the arr
# apps search for (Movies/TV/Audio/Books/PC), so the Applications above have
# something real to sync to and Prowlarr's search actually returns results
# out of the box. Along the way it
# also creates each arr app's initial WebUI login (the placeholder
# username/password the README's login table documents) and relaxes
# CertificateValidation for internal addresses, since download client
# creation needs both and nothing else in this stack sets them up.
#
# It also attempts the first-run setup that Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf,
# Calibre's content server, and Calibre-Web each need before they have any
# usable account at all (see the "First-run setup" section below), since
# scripts/rotate-*.sh can't rotate a credential that doesn't exist yet. This
# reliably succeeds for three of the four; Jellyfin's is unreliable for
# reasons not fully understood (see that function's own comment) and often
# needs a one-time manual visit to its web UI instead.
#
# These specifically cannot be seeded from a template the way most of this
# stack's config is: they live in each arr app's SQLite database
# (DownloadClients / Applications tables), which is deliberately never
# tracked or pre-populated (see docs/HARDENING.md). Two related connections
# are NOT handled here because they already work out of the box:
#   - Bazarr's Sonarr/Radarr connections: configs/bazarr/config/config/
#     config.yaml.example already ships ip/port/base_url/ssl plus the same
#     placeholder API key sonarr/radarr's own config.xml.example uses, so
#     they match by construction.
#   - Mylar/LazyLibrarian's qBittorrent/SABnzbd connections: their
#     config.ini.example files are pre-filled the same way, since both apps
#     are configured from a flat file rather than a database.
# See docs/CONNECTIONS.md for the full picture.
#
# Idempotent: every creation is preceded by a check for an existing entry, so
# re-running this after `make start` again, or after rotating credentials, is
# always safe and just confirms everything is still wired.

  # Deliberately not fatal. Every entry in wire_prowlarr_apps runs in one
  # function inside one background job, so under `set -e` a single failing
  # POST used to kill that job outright, silently skipping every remaining
  # app AND the indexer, with the `|| true` on this job's own wait_job call
  # swallowing the failure so nothing in the bootstrap output even hinted at
  # it. (That `|| true` used to live inside wait_job itself; it moved to the
  # call sites when the arr jobs started reporting their Jellyfin status, and
  # the Prowlarr job kept it.) Confirmed live: a real
  # bootstrap printed "Registering application 'LazyLibrarian'..." and then
  # nothing at all, leaving Prowlarr with zero applications and zero
  # indexers. Record the failure, keep going, and surface it in the summary.
  #
  # This POST makes Prowlarr call back into the app to verify the link,
  # which for some apps (confirmed live: Lidarr) includes the app's own
  # HttpClient validating *our* self-signed cert against the bare container
  # hostname ("prowlarr"), which isn't in the cert's SAN list. Fatal only in
  # the split second right after the app's HTTP listener first binds: this
  # app's own reachability retry above only proves the listener answers, not
  # that its TLS/cert subsystem has finished warming up, and every
  # observed failure was Lidarr's very first attempt at an outbound HTTPS
  # connection to "prowlarr" (its own log showed "Now listening" one second
  # before "Certificate validation for prowlarr failed"). Retrying moments
  # later, once the app is no longer freshly started, self-heals: confirmed
  # live, re-running registration by hand right after this same failure
  # succeeded immediately.
