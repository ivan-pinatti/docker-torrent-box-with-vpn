#
# Pre-creates a valid, empty Calibre library at data/media/calibre-library
# before any container ever starts, using a throwaway container running
# calibredb (the same image the real calibre/calibre-web containers use).
#
# Calibre's desktop GUI auto-opens its configured library immediately on
# container boot; on a fresh bootstrap, that means it's the one creating
# metadata.db for the very first time, in-process, at the same moment the
# container's own startup scripts are still running. That's a real reported
# failure mode ("library database appears to be corrupted" on first login),
# not reproduced via any headless check afterward (calibredb, SQLite
# integrity, Calibre-Web's own dbconfig page all show a healthy library
# once things settle), consistent with a narrow first-open race rather than
# lasting damage. Pre-creating the library here removes that race entirely:
# by the time the real container starts, metadata.db already exists and is
# already valid, so its own first open is just a normal, existing-library
# open, not a first-ever creation.
#
# Skips entirely if metadata.db already exists, so this is a no-op on every
# run after the first.
