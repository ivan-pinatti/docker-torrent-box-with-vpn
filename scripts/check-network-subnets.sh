# Usage: ./scripts/check-network-subnets.sh
#
# Refuses to start when a network already exists on a different subnet than .env
# now asks for. `make start`'s own "ensure required networks exist" step is
# `network exists X || network create --subnet ...`, so an existing network is
# reused whatever subnet it carries, and a podman network outlives the stack it
# belongs to: stopping does not remove it. Change SERVICES_SUBNET and the network
# keeps the old range, while the compose files hand containers an
# `ipv4_address:` from the new one. The container then fails to attach, or
# attaches somewhere nothing can reach it, and neither message mentions the
# subnet.
#
# Removing the network automatically is deliberately not what happens here. It
# would disconnect whatever else is attached, including another checkout's
# running stack, which is precisely the situation these variables exist to keep
# apart. Naming the mismatch and stopping is the useful behavior.

# podman and docker disagree on both of these. `network exists` is podman only,
# and the inspect format differs: podman puts subnets in `.Subnets`, docker in
# `.IPAM.Config`. Handing docker the podman template does not return empty, it
# raises "map has no entry for key \"Subnets\"", which a swallowed error would
# turn into an empty answer and a guard that passes whatever the subnet is.
# Confirmed against docker 29.0.4 and podman 5.8.4. Both shapes are tried rather
# than branching on the runtime name, so this keeps working if either changes
# which one it reports.

Containers would be given an ipv4_address outside the network they attach to.
Stop this stack and remove the networks above so they are recreated on the
subnets ${ENV_FILE} now declares:

  make stop_all
  ${RUNTIME} network rm ${project}_services ${project}_observability ${project}_media

Check nothing else is attached first: another checkout sharing these subnets is
why they are worth changing in the first place.
