"""Tests for .claude/hooks/git-guard.sh, the PreToolUse hook on the Bash tool.

The hook enforces three rules that were prose in CLAUDE.md and got broken
anyway: no skipping the pre-commit hooks, no working-tree git operations while
the stack is running, and no committing into a clone where the hooks were never
installed.

Nothing here touches the real stack; podman is stubbed on PATH so both stack
states are deterministic. Rule 3 does need real repositories, so those cases
build throwaway ones under tmp_path rather than asking about this checkout,
whose answer depends on whether anyone has run `pre-commit install` in it (CI
never has, a developer's clone usually has).
