"""Integration tests for scripts/rotate-passwords.sh.

These tests execute the rotation script against the live stack, verify the new
password is accepted and propagated to every consumer, then restore the original
password. They are marked `rotation` and `pw_rotation`.

App ports are not published to the host, so all API calls run curl inside the
target container (see conftest.container_http), matching how the rotation
scripts themselves talk to the apps.

Run explicitly with:
    pytest -m pw_rotation

Run everything else, skipping just this file:
    pytest -m "not pw_rotation"
