"""Static checks that every pinned container image is actually watched.

A pin and a watched pin look identical in `.env.example`. Twelve pins sat in
the `### VERSIONS` block with no `# renovate:` annotation above them, so
nothing bumped them and they froze, several for more than a year, while the
file still read as fully pinned. Nothing in the repository said so, which is
the only reason it lasted. These tests make that state fail on the pull
request that introduces it.

Three ways a pin goes quiet without looking wrong, one test each. No
annotation at all, so Renovate never sees the variable. An annotation the
customManager's regex cannot parse, which reads as watched to a person and is
invisible to the bot. A `packageRules` entry naming a package no annotation
declares: one rule listed five observability images by bare repository name
while the annotations are registry-qualified, so it matched zero of its five
members, and another named `ghcr.io/tprasadtp/protonwire`, which this
repository has never pulled.

Marked `prerequisites` rather than carrying a marker of its own, so
`make test_prerequisites` picks it up. That target is what the `Prerequisite
Checks` job in .github/workflows/pull-request-validation.yml runs, so these
gate every pull request without waiting on the integration suite, which is the
point: an unwatched pin is a review-time mistake, not a runtime failure.

No containers and no stack state, so these run anywhere:
